# NeverClicker
Automated invocation and leadership queueing.

## Caveats and Current Issues
- Client must run in 'Windowed Maximized' mode at 1920x1080.
- Client must be running DirectX 9 (there is little reason to run DirectX 11 anyway).
- Keyboard bindings (keybinds) must be configured in the game client for:
  - Invocation
  - Inventory
  - Professions
- Keybinds must be a single keyboard key (such as '9' or 'v') and **cannot** require modifiers (ALT, CTRL, etc.)
  - One method is to bind:
    - Invocation to '8'
	- Professions to '9'
	- and Inventory to '0'
  - Obviously, use whatever single-key binding you prefer.
  - This keybind can be configured in addition to your present key binding in the game options so that you don't need to re-learn a new binding.
- You must configure the .ini configuration files manually. You can access the files from within the settings menu for convenience. 
- Currently mercenaries are the only optional assets which can be added to leadership tasks.

# NeverClicker
Automated invocation and leadership queueing

## Caveats and Current Issues
- Client must run in windowed fullscreen at 1920x1080
- Client must be running DirectX 9 (there is little reason to run DirectX 11 anyway)
- Keyboard bindings (keybinds) must be configured in the game client for:
  - Invocation
  - Inventory
  - Professions
- Keybinds must be a single keyboard key (such as '0' or 'v') and cannot require modifiers (ALT, CTRL, etc.)
  - One method is to bind:
    - Invocation to '8'
	- Professions to '9'
	- and Inventory to '0'
  - Obviously, use whatever single-key binding you prefer.
  - This keybind can be configured in addition to your present key binding in the game options so that you don't need to re-learn a new binding.
